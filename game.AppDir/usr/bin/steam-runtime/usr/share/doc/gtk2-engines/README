gtk-engines
===========

gtk-engines provides a central location for commonly used GTK+ engines.

It currently supplies several engines and default themes for those which have one.

Clearlooks
  The clearlooks engine was originally written by Richard Stellingwerff and
  Daniel Borgmann based on the Bluecurve engine. It became very popular and
  was adopted as the default theme in GNOME 2.12.
  Since then a lot of people have worked on it, and today it is a modular
  engine providing multiple styles such as glossy and gummy.
  There are some popular forks out there, the largest is probably the
  UbuntuLooks engine currently used for the default Ubuntu theme.

Crux
  The engine created for the once popular theme by Eazel, Inc. Unfortunately
  long without maintenance it is no longer as popular or considered as
  usable as it once was.
  It has been rewritten by Thomas Wood and now provides a more modern style
  featuring the Tango colors.

Glide
  A new engine written by Andrew Johnson for the Glider theme.

HC
  The High Contrast engine which is targeted for usability themes, such as
  the GNOME HighContrast theme.

Industrial
  Originally developed by Ximian, Inc. as the default engine for its desktop.
  Industrial provides a simple and consistent appearance for applications.
  
LUA
  The LUA engine is an experimental engine that loads lua scripts to draw
  the interface. Because of its experimental status the engine is not
  compiled by default.

Mist
  A minimalist engine designed to provide a simple UI experience.

Redmond
  An engine and theme designed to mimic the appearance of another well
  known OS.

Thinice
  A once highly popular engine with thin edges and theme of Icy Colors,
  providing a simple mostly clean appearance many find satisfying.


Requirements
============

To compile this package, you must have:

 GTK+, version 2.12.0 or later

   http://www.gtk.org/
   ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/


Sources
=======

The source code of gtk-engines is available from:
  http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/GNOME/sources/gtk-engines/

The development version is available from gtk-engines module of the GNOME
subversion repository:
  http://svn.gnome.org


Bugs
====

GTK+ engines are a vital part of the desktop and should be very stable. A
bug in the engine can easily cause random application crashes and users may
lose work.

Because of this gtk-engines has a test suite which torture tests the engines
and checks for some other issues. While we strive to create very stable
software, bugs do crop up regularly. Should you find any problem, whether it is
a visual or a more serious issue please fill them in the GNOME bugzilla in the
gtk-engines product.

Installation
============

 ./configure 
 make
 [ become root ]
 make install


If you configured GTK+ in a non-default prefix, you should configure this
package the same way. For instance:

 ./configure --prefix=/opt/gtk+

If you need to install this package in a different prefix from GTK+, then
you'll have to set your GTK_PATH environment variable to point to the
installed prefix. For instance, if this package was configured with:

 ./configure --prefix=/home/john.doe/gtk-engines/

Then you'd set:

 GTK_PATH=/home/john.doe/gtk-engines/lib/gtk-2.0/
 export GTK_PATH

This will allow GTK+ to find the newly installed theme engines. To use the
default themes (installed into $prefix/share/themes), you'll need to copy or
link them into your  ~/.themes directory.

If you need to skip an engine/theme configure with --disable-<engine>. A
--disable-all option is included so that it is possible to enable building
of engines selectively with --enable-<engine>.
