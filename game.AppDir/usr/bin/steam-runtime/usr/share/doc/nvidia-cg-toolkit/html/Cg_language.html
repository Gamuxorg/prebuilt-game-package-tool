<H1><A NAME="CG_LANGUAGE_SPECIFICATION"><A NAME="1">Cg Language Specification

</A></A></H1>
<P>
Copyright (c) 2001-2011 NVIDIA Corp.


</P>
<P>
This is version 2.0 of the Cg Language specification.  This language
specification describes version 2.0 of the Cg language


</P>

<H1><A NAME="LANGUAGE_OVERVIEW"><A NAME="2">Language Overview

</A></A></H1>
<P>
The Cg language is primarily modeled on ANSI C, but adopts some ideas from
modern languages such as C++ and Java, and from earlier shading languages
such as RenderMan and the Stanford shading language. The language also
introduces a few new ideas.  In particular, it includes features designed
to represent data flow in stream-processing architectures such as GPUs.
Profiles, which are specified at compile time, may subset certain
features of the language, including the ability to implement loops and
the precision at which certain computations are performed.


</P>
<P>
Like C, Cg is designed primarily as a low-level programming language.
Features are provided that map as directly as possible to hardware
capabilities.  Higher level abstractions are designed primarily to not
get in the way of writing code that maps directly to the hardware in
the most efficient way possible.  The changes in the language from C
primarily reflect differences in the way GPU hardware works compared
to conventional CPUs.  GPUs are designed to run large numbers of small
threads of processing in parallel, each running a copy of the same program
on a different data set.


</P>

<H1><A NAME="DIFFERENCES_FROM_ANSI_C"><A NAME="3">Differences from ANSI C

</A></A></H1>
<P>
Cg was developed based on the ANSI-C language with the following major
additions, deletions, and changes. (This is a summary-more detail is
provided later in this document):


</P>

<H2><A NAME="SILENT_INCOMPATIBILITIES"><A NAME="4">Silent Incompatibilities

</A></A></H2>
<P>
Most of the changes from ANSI C are either omissions or additions,
but there are a few potentially silent incompatibilities.  These are
changes within Cg that could cause a program that compiles
without errors to behave in a manner different from C:


</P>
<UL>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
The type promotion rules for constants are different when the constant
is not explicitly typed using a type cast or type suffix. In general,
a binary operation between a constant that is not explicitly typed and
a variable is performed at the variable's precision, rather than at the
constant's default precision.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
Declarations of <CODE>struct</CODE> perform an automatic <CODE>typedef</CODE> (as in C++) and
thus could override a previously declared type.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
Arrays are first-class types that are distinct from pointers.  As a
result, array assignments semantically perform a copy operation for the
entire array.


</P>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="SIMILAR_OPERATIONS_THAT_MUST_BE_EXPRESSED_DIFFERENTLY"><A NAME="5">Similar Operations That Must be Expressed Differently

</A></A></H2>
<P>
There are several changes that force the same operation to be
expressed differently in Cg than in C:


</P>
<UL>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
A Boolean type, <CODE>bool</CODE>, is introduced, with corresponding implications
for operators and control constructs.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
Arrays are first-class types because Cg does not support pointers.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
Functions pass values by value/result, and thus use an <CODE>out</CODE> or <CODE>inout</CODE>
modifier in the formal parameter list to return a parameter.  By default,
formal parameters are <CODE>in</CODE>, but it is acceptable to specify this explicitly.
Parameters can also be specified as <CODE>in out</CODE>, which is semantically the
same as <CODE>inout</CODE>.


</P>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="C_FEATURES_NOT_PRESENT_IN_CG"><A NAME="6">C features not present in Cg

</A></A></H2>
<UL>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
Language profiles (described in the <A HREF="#PROFILES">Profiles</A> section) may
subset language capabilities in a variety of ways.  In particular,
language profiles may restrict the use of for and while loops.
For example, some profiles may only support loops that can be fully
unrolled at compile time.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
Reserved keywords <CODE>goto</CODE>, <CODE>switch</CODE>, <CODE>case</CODE>, and <CODE>default</CODE> are not
supported, nor are labels.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
Pointers and pointer-related capabilities, such as the <CODE>&</CODE> and
<CODE>-></CODE> operators, are not supported.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
Arrays are supported, but with some limitations on size and
dimensionality.  Restrictions on the use of computed subscripts are also
permitted.  Arrays may be designated as <CODE>packed</CODE>.  The operations allowed on
packed arrays may be different from those allowed on unpacked arrays.
Predefined <CODE>packed</CODE> types are provided for vectors and matrices. It
is strongly recommended that these predefined types be used.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
There is no <CODE>enum</CODE> or <CODE>union</CODE>.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
There are no bit-field declarations in structures.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
All integral types are implicitly signed, there is no <I>signed</I> keyword.


</P>
</UL>

</A></A></H2>
<UL>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
A <I>binding semantic</I> may be associated with a structure tag, a
variable, or a structure element to denote that object's mapping
to a specific hardware or API resource.  Binding semantics are described
in the <I>Binding Semantics</I> section.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
There is a built-in swizzle operator: <CODE>.xyzw</CODE> or <CODE>.rgba</CODE> for vectors.
This operator allows the components of a vector to be rearranged and also
replicated.  It also allows the creation of a vector from a scalar.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
For an lvalue, the swizzle operator allows components of a vector or
matrix to be selectively written.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
There is a similar built-in swizzle operator for matrices:
<CODE>._m<row><col>[_m<row><col>][...]</CODE>.  This operator allows access to
individual matrix components and allows the creation of a vector from
elements of a matrix.  For compatibility with DirectX 8 notation, there
is a second form of matrix swizzle, which is described later.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
Numeric data types are different.
Cg's primary numeric data types are <CODE>float</CODE>, <CODE>half</CODE>, and <CODE>fixed</CODE>.
Fragment profiles are required to support all three data types, but
may choose to implement <CODE>half</CODE> and/or <CODE>fixed</CODE> at <CODE>float</CODE> precision.
Vertex profiles are required to support <CODE>half</CODE> and <CODE>float</CODE>, but
may choose to implement <CODE>half</CODE> at <CODE>float</CODE> precision.
Vertex profiles may omit support for <CODE>fixed</CODE> operations, but must
still support definition of <CODE>fixed</CODE> variables.
Cg allows profiles to omit run-time support for <CODE>int</CODE> and other integer types.
Cg allows profiles to treat <CODE>double</CODE> as <CODE>float</CODE>.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
Many operators support per-element vector operations.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
The <CODE>?:</CODE>, <CODE>||</CODE>, <CODE>&&</CODE>, <CODE>!</CODE>, and comparison operators can be used with
<CODE>bool</CODE> vectors to perform multiple conditional operations
simultaneously.
The side effects of all operands to vector <CODE>?:</CODE>, <CODE>||</CODE>, and <CODE>&&</CODE> operators are
always executed.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
Non-static global variables, and parameters to top-level functions
(such as main()) may be designated as <CODE>uniform</CODE>.  A <CODE>uniform</CODE>
variable may be read and written within a program, just like any
other variable.  However, the uniform modifier indicates that the
initial value of the variable/parameter is expected to be constant
across a large number of invocations of the program.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
A new set of <CODE>sampler*</CODE> types represents handles to texture sampler units.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
Functions may have default values for their parameters, as in C++.
These defaults are expressed using assignment syntax.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
Function and operator overloading is supported.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
Variables may be defined anywhere before they are used, rather than
just at the beginning of a scope as in C. (That is, we adopt the C++
rules that govern where variable declarations are allowed.)
Variables may not be redeclared within the same scope.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
Vector constructors, such as the form <CODE>float4(1,2,3,4)</CODE>, and
matrix constructors may be used anywhere in an expression.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
A <CODE>struct</CODE> definition automatically performs a corresponding <CODE>typedef</CODE>,
as in C++.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
C++-style <CODE>//</CODE> comments are allowed in addition to C-style
<CODE>/*</CODE> ... <CODE>*/</CODE> comments.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
A limited form of inheritance is supported;  <CODE>interface</CODE> types may be
defined which contain only member functions (no data members) and <CODE>struct</CODE>
types may inherit from a single interface and provide specific implementations
for all the member functions.  Interface objects may not be created; a
variable of interface type may have any implementing struct type assigned
to it.


</P>

<H1><A NAME="DETAILED_LANGUAGE_SPECIFICATION"><A NAME="8">Detailed Language Specification

</A></A></H1>

<H2><A NAME="DEFINITIONS"><A NAME="9">Definitions

</A></A></H2>
<P>
The following definitions are based on the ANSI C standard:


</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Object

</STRONG></DT>
<DD>

<P>
An object is a region of data storage in the execution
environment, the contents of which can represent values. When
referenced, an object may be interpreted as having a particular
type.


</P>
<DT><STRONG>Declaration

</STRONG></DT>
<DD>

<P>
A declaration specifies the interpretation and attributes of a set
of identifiers.


</P>
<DT><STRONG>Definition

</STRONG></DT>
<DD>

<P>
A declaration that also causes storage to be reserved for an
object or code that will be generated for a function named by an
identifier is a definition.


</P>
</DD></DL>

<H2><A NAME="PROFILES"><A NAME="10">Profiles

</A></A></H2>
<P>
Compilation of a Cg program, a top-level function, always occurs in
the context of a compilation profile.  The profile specifies whether
certain optional language features are supported.  These
optional language features include certain control constructs and
standard library functions.  The compilation profile also defines the
precision of the <CODE>float</CODE>, <CODE>half</CODE>, and <CODE>fixed</CODE> data types, and
specifies whether the <CODE>fixed</CODE> and <CODE>sampler*</CODE> data types are
fully or only partially supported.  The profile also specifies the environment
in which the program will be run.
The choice of a compilation profile is made externally to the language,
by using a compiler command-line switch, for example.


</P>
<P>
The profile restrictions are only applied to the top-level function
that is being compiled and to any variables or functions that it
references, either directly or indirectly.  If a function is present in the
source code, but not called directly or indirectly by the top-level
function, it is free to use capabilities that are not supported
by the current profile.


</P>
<P>
The intent of these rules is to allow a single Cg source file to
contain many different top-level functions that are targeted at
different profiles.  The core Cg language specification is
sufficiently complete to allow all of these functions to be parsed.
The restrictions provided by a compilation profile are only needed for
code generation, and are therefore only applied to those functions for
which code is being generated.  This specification uses the word
"program" to refer to the top-level function, any functions
the top-level function calls, and any global variables or typedef
definitions it references.


</P>
<P>
Each profile must have a separate specification that describes its
characteristics and limitations.


</P>
<P>
This core Cg specification requires certain minimum capabilities for
all profiles.  In some cases, the core specification distinguishes
between vertex-program and fragment-program profiles, with different
minimum capabilities for each.


</P>

<H2><A NAME="DECLARATIONS_AND_DECLARATION_SPECIFIERS."><A NAME="11">Declarations and declaration specifiers.

</A></A></H2>
<P>
A Cg program consists of a series of declarations, each of which
declares one or more variables or functions, or declares and defines
a single function.  Each declaration consists of zero or more
declaration specifiers, a type, and one or more declarators.  Some
of the declaration specifiers are the same as those in ANSI C;
others are new to Cg


</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><B>const</B>

</STRONG></DT>
<DD>

<P>
Marks a variable as a constant that cannot be assigned to within the
program.  Unless this is combined with <CODE>uniform</CODE> or <CODE>varying</CODE>, the
declarator must include an initializer to give the variable a value.


</P>
<DT><STRONG><B>extern</B>

</STRONG></DT>
<DD>

<P>
Marks this declaration as solely a declaration and not a definition.
There must be a non-<CODE>extern</CODE> declaration elsewhere in the program.


</P>
<DT><STRONG><B>in</B>

</STRONG></DT>
<DD>

<P>
Only usable on parameter and <CODE>varying</CODE> declarations.  Marks the parameter
or varying as an input to the function or program.  Function parameters
with no <CODE>in</CODE>, <CODE>out</CODE>, or <CODE>inout</CODE> specifier are implicitly <CODE>in</CODE>


</P>
<DT><STRONG><B>inline</B>

</STRONG></DT>
<DD>

<P>
Only usable on a function definition.  Tells the compiler that it should
always inline calls to the function if at all possible.


</P>
<DT><STRONG><B>inout</B>

</STRONG></DT>
<DD>

<P>
Only usable on parameter and <CODE>varying</CODE> declarations.  Marks the parameter
or varying as both an input to and an output from the function or program


</P>
<DT><STRONG><B>static</B>

</STRONG></DT>
<DD>

<P>
Only usable on global variables.  Marks the variable as 'private' to the
program, and not visible externally.   Cannot be combined with <CODE>uniform</CODE> or <CODE>varying</CODE>


</P>
<DT><STRONG><B>out</B>

</STRONG></DT>
<DD>

<P>
Only usable on parameter and <CODE>varying</CODE> declarations.  Marks the parameter
or varying as an output from the function or program


</P>
<DT><STRONG><B>uniform</B>

</STRONG></DT>
<DD>

<P>
Only usable on global variables and parameters to the top-level main function
of a program.  If specified on a non-top-level function parameter it is ignored.
The intent of this rule is to allow
a function to serve as either a top-level function or as one that is not.


</P>
<P>
Note that <CODE>uniform</CODE> variables may be read and written just like
non-<CODE>uniform</CODE> variables.  The <CODE>uniform</CODE> qualifier simply provides
information about how the initial value of the variable is to be
specified and stored, through a mechanism external to the language.


</P>
<DT><STRONG><B>varying</B>

</STRONG></DT>
<DD>

<P>
Only usable on global variables and parameters to the top-level main function
of a program.  If specified on a non-top-level function parameter it is ignored.


</P>
<DT><STRONG><B>profile name</B>

</STRONG></DT>
<DD>

<P>
The name of any profile (or profile wildcard -- see <A HREF="#PROFILES">Profiles</A>) may
be used as a specifier on any function declaration.  It defines a function
that is only visible in the corresponding profiles.


</P>
</DD></DL>
<P>
The specifiers <CODE>uniform</CODE> and <CODE>varying</CODE> specify how data is transferred
between the rest of the world and a Cg program.  
Typically, the initial value of a <CODE>uniform</CODE> variable or parameter is stored
in a different class of hardware register for a <CODE>varying</CODE>.  Furthermore, the external
mechanism for specifying the initial value of <CODE>uniform</CODE>
variables or parameters may be different than that used for specifying
the initial value of <CODE>varying</CODE> variables or parameters.  Parameters qualified
as <CODE>uniform</CODE> are normally treated as persistent state, while <CODE>varying</CODE>
parameters are treated as streaming data, with a new value specified
for each stream record (such as within a vertex array).


</P>
<P>
Non-<CODE>static</CODE> global variables are treated as <CODE>uniform</CODE> by default, while
parameters to the top-level function are treated as <CODE>varying</CODE> by default.


</P>
<P>
Each declaration is visible ("in scope") from the point of its declarator
until the end of the enclosing block or the end of the compilation unit
if outside any block.  Declarations in named scopes (such as structs and
interfaces) may be visible outside of their scope using explicit scope
qualifiers, as in C++.


</P>

<H2><A NAME="SEMANTICS"><A NAME="12">Semantics

</A></A></H2>
<P>
Each declarator in a declaration may optionally have a semantic specified
with it.  A semantic specifies how the variable is connected to the environment
in which the program runs.  All semantics are profile specific (so they
have different meanings in different profiles), though there is some
attempt to be consistent across profiles.  Each profile specification must
specify the set of semantics which the profile understands, as well as
what behavior occurs for any other unspecified semantics.


</P>

<H2><A NAME="FUNCTION_DECLARATIONS"><A NAME="13">Function Declarations

</A></A></H2>
<P>
Functions are declared essentially as in C.  A function that does not
return a value must be declared with a <CODE>void</CODE> return type.  A function
that takes no parameters may be declared in one of two ways:


</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>As in C, using the void keyword:

</STRONG></DT>
<DD>

<PRE>        functionName(void)
</PRE><DT><STRONG>With no parameters at all:

</STRONG></DT>
<DD>

<PRE>        functionName()
</PRE></DD></DL>
<P>
Functions may be declared as <CODE>static</CODE>.  If so, they may not be
compiled as a program and are not visible externally


</P>

<H2><A NAME="FUNCTION_OVERLOADING_AND_OPTIONAL_ARGUMENTS"><A NAME="14">Function overloading and optional arguments

</A></A></H2>
<P>
Cg supports function overloading; that is you may define multiple functions
with the same name.  The function actually called at any given call site
is based on the types of the arguments at that call site; the definition
that best matches is called.  See the <A HREF="#FUNCTION_OVERLOADING">function overloading</A>
section for the precise rules.  Trailing arguments with initializers are
optional arguments; defining a function with optional arguments is
equivalent to defining multiple overloaded functions that differ by having
and not having the optional argument.  The value of the initializer is
used only for the version that does not have the argument and is ignored
if the argument is present.


</P>

<H2><A NAME="OVERLOADING_OF_FUNCTIONS_BY_PROFILE"><A NAME="15">Overloading of Functions by Profile

</A></A></H2>
<P>
Cg supports overloading of functions by compilation profile.  This
capability allows a function to be implemented differently for
different profiles.  It is also useful because different profiles may
support different subsets of the language capabilities, and because
the most efficient implementation of a function may be different for
different profiles.


</P>
<P>
The profile name must precede the return type name in the
function declaration. For example, to define two different versions of
the function <CODE>myfunc</CODE> for the <CODE>profileA</CODE> and <CODE>profileB</CODE> profiles:


</P>
<PRE>        profileA float myfunc(float x) {...};
        profileB float myfunc(float x) {...};
</PRE><P>
If a type is defined (using a <CODE>typedef</CODE>) that has the same name as a
profile, the identifier is treated as a type name, and is not
available for profile overloading at any subsequent point in the
file.


</P>
<P>
If a function definition does not include a profile, the function
is referred to as an "open-profile" function.  Open-profile functions
apply to all profiles.


</P>
<P>
Several wildcard profile names are defined.  The name <CODE>vs</CODE> matches any
vertex profile, while the name <CODE>ps</CODE> matches any fragment or pixel profile.
The names <CODE>ps_1</CODE> and <CODE>ps_2</CODE> match any DX8 pixel shader 1.x profile,
or DX9 pixel shader 2.x profile, respectively.
Similarly, the names <CODE>vs_1</CODE> and <CODE>vs_2</CODE> match any DX vertex
shader 1.x or 2.x, respectively.  Additional valid wildcard profile
names may be defined by individual profiles.


</P>
<P>
In general, the most specific version of a function is used.
More details are provided in the section on function overloading,
but roughly speaking, the search order is the following:


</P>
<OL>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
version of the function with the exact profile overload


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
version of the function with the most specific wildcard profile overload (e.g.  <CODE>vs</CODE>, "ps_1")


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
version of function with no profile overload


</P>
</OL>
<P>
This search process allows generic versions of a function to be
defined that can be overridden as needed for particular hardware.

<P>
Functions are declared in a manner similar to C, but the parameters
in function definitions may include a binding semantic (discussed
later) and a default value.


</P>
<P>
Each parameter in a function definition takes the following form:


</P>
<PRE>  &lt;declspecs&gt; &lt;type&gt; identifier [: &lt;binding_semantic&gt;] [= &lt;default&gt;]
</PRE><P>
<I> <default</I> > is an expression that resolves to a constant at compile time.

<H2><A NAME="FUNCTION_CALLS"><A NAME="17">Function Calls

</A></A></H2>
<P>
A function call returns an rvalue. Therefore, if a function returns an
array, the array may be read but not written. For example, the following
is allowed:


</P>
<PRE>        y = myfunc(x)[2];
</PRE><P>
But, this is not:


</P>
<PRE>        myfunc(x)[2] = y;
</PRE><P>
For multiple function calls within an expression, the calls can occur
in any order--it is undefined.

<CODE>short</CODE> is no larger than <CODE>int</CODE> and <CODE>long</CODE> is at least as large as <CODE>int</CODE>


</P>

Overflow operations on the data type clamp rather than wrap.
Fragment profiles must support the <CODE>fixed</CODE> type, but may
implement it with the same precision as the <CODE>half</CODE> or <CODE>float</CODE> types.
Vertex profiles are required to provide partial support
(as defined below) for the <CODE>fixed</CODE> type.
Vertex profiles have the option to provide full support for the <CODE>fixed</CODE>
type or to implement the <CODE>fixed</CODE> type with the same precision as
the <CODE>half</CODE> or <CODE>float</CODE> types.

The <CODE>bool</CODE> type represents Boolean values.
Objects of <CODE>bool</CODE> type are either true or false.

The <CODE>cint</CODE> type is 32-bit two's complement.  This type is meaningful
only at compile time; it is not possible to declare objects of type
<CODE>cint</CODE>.


</P>

The <CODE>sampler*</CODE> types are handles to texture objects.  Formal
parameters of a program or function may be of type <CODE>sampler*</CODE>.  No

The base <CODE>sampler</CODE> type may be used in any context in which
a more specific sampler type is valid.  However, a <CODE>sampler</CODE>
variable must be used in a consistent way throughout the program.
For example, it cannot be used in place of both a <CODE>sampler1D</CODE>

Fragment profiles are required to fully support the <CODE>sampler</CODE>,
<CODE>sampler1D</CODE>, <CODE>sampler2D</CODE>, <CODE>sampler3D</CODE>, and <CODE>samplerCUBE</CODE> data types.
Fragment profiles are required to provide partial support

Vertex profiles are required to provide partial support for
the six sampler data types and may optionally provide full

Some array types may be optionally designated as <CODE>packed</CODE>, using the
<CODE>packed</CODE> type modifier.  The storage format of a <CODE>packed</CODE> type may
be different from the storage format of the corresponding unpacked
type.  The storage format of packed types is implementation
dependent, but must be consistent for any particular
combination of compiler and profile.  The operations supported on a packed
type in a particular profile may be different than the operations
supported on the corresponding unpacked type in that same profile.
Profiles may define a maximum allowable size for packed arrays, but must
support at least size 4 for packed vector (1D array) types,
and 4x4 for packed matrix (2D array) types.

When declaring an array of arrays in a single declaration, the

For any supported numeric data type <I>TYPE</I>, implementations must

For example, implementations must predefine the type identifiers
<CODE>float2x1</CODE>, <CODE>float3x3</CODE>, <CODE>float4x4</CODE>, and so on.  A typedef

These rules are not limited to arrays of numeric types, and thus imply

<H2><A NAME="USE_OF_UNINITIALIZED_VARIABLES"><A NAME="34">Use of Uninitialized Variables

It is incorrect for a program to use an uninitialized static or local variable.
However, the compiler is not obligated to detect such errors, even if
it would be possible to do so by compile-time data-flow analysis.  The
value obtained from reading an uninitialized variable is undefined.
This same rule applies to the implicit use of a variable that occurs
when it is returned by a top-level function.  In particular, if a
top-level function returns a <CODE>struct</CODE>, and some element of that <CODE>struct</CODE>
is never written, then the value of that element is undefined.


</P>

<H1><A NAME="OVERVIEW_OF_BINDING_SEMANTICS"><A NAME="36">Overview of Binding Semantics

</A></A></H1>
<P>
In stream-processing architectures, data packets flow between
different programmable units.  On a GPU, for example, packets of
vertex data flow from the application to the vertex program.


</P>
<P>
Because packets are produced by one program (the application, in this case),
and consumed by another (the vertex program), there must be some
mechanism for defining the interface between the two.  Cg
allows the user to choose between two different approaches to defining
these interfaces.


</P>
<P>
The first approach is to associate a binding semantic with each
element of the packet.  This approach is a <I>bind-by-name</I> approach.  For
example, an output with the binding semantic <CODE>FOO</CODE> is fed to an input
with the binding semantic <CODE>FOO</CODE>.  Profiles may allow the user to
define arbitrary identifiers in this "semantic namespace", or they may
restrict the allowed identifiers to a predefined set.  Often, these
predefined names correspond to the names of hardware registers or API
resources.


</P>
<P>
In some cases, predefined names may control non-programmable parts of
the hardware.  For example, vertex programs normally compute a
position that is fed to the rasterizer, and this position is stored in
an output with the binding semantic <CODE>POSITION</CODE>.


</P>
<P>
For any profile, there are two namespaces for predefined
binding semantics--the namespace used for <CODE>in</CODE> variables and the
namespace used for <CODE>out</CODE> variables.  The primary implication of having
two namespaces is that the binding semantic cannot be used to
implicitly specify whether a variable is <CODE>in</CODE> or <CODE>out</CODE>.


</P>
<P>
The second approach to defining data packets is to describe the data
that is present in a packet and allow the compiler to decide how to
store it.  In Cg, the user can describe the contents of a data packet
by placing all of its contents into a <CODE>struct</CODE>.  When a <CODE>struct</CODE> is used
in this manner, we refer to it as a <I>connector</I>.  The two approaches
are not mutually exclusive, as is discussed later.
The connector approach allows the user to rely on a combination of
user-specified semantic bindings and compiler-determined bindings.


</P>

<H2><A NAME="BINDING_SEMANTICS"><A NAME="37">Binding Semantics

<P>
A binding semantic may be associated with an input to a top-level
function or a global variable in one of three ways:


</P>
<UL>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
The binding semantic is specified in the formal parameter
declaration for the function. The syntax for formal parameters to a
function is:


</P>
<PRE>        [const] [in | out | inout] &lt;type&gt; &lt;identifier&gt; [: &lt;binding-semantic&gt;] [= &lt;initializer&gt;];
</PRE><LI>


</LI>
<P>
If the formal parameter is a <CODE>struct</CODE>, the binding semantic may be
specified with an element of the <CODE>struct</CODE> when the <CODE>struct</CODE> is
defined:


</P>
<PRE>        struct &lt;struct-tag&gt; {
            &lt;type&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;[ : &lt;binding-semantic&gt;];
              ...
        };
</PRE><LI>


</LI>
<P>
If the input to the function is implicit (a non-static global variable
that is read by the function), the binding semantic may be specified
when the non-static global variable is declared:


</P>
<PRE>        [varying [in | out]] &lt;type&gt; &lt;identifier&gt; [ : &lt;binding-semantic&gt;];
</PRE><P>
If the non-static global variable is a <CODE>struct,</CODE> the binding semantic may
be specified when the <CODE>struct</CODE> is defined, as described in the second bullet above.


</P>
<LI>


</LI>
<P>
A binding semantic may be associated with the output of a top-level
function in a similar manner:


</P>
<PRE>        &lt;type&gt; &lt;identifier&gt; ( &lt;parameter-list&gt; ) [: &lt;binding-semantic&gt;]
        {
                :
</PRE></UL>
<P>
Another method available for specifying a semantic for an output value
is to return a <CODE>struct</CODE>, and to specify the binding semantic(s) with
elements of the <CODE>struct</CODE> when the <CODE>struct</CODE> is defined.  In addition, if
the output
is a formal parameter, then the binding semantic may be specified
using the same approach used to specify binding semantics for inputs.


</P>

<H2><A NAME="ALIASING_OF_SEMANTICS"><A NAME="38">Aliasing of Semantics

</A></A></H2>
<P>
Semantics must honor a copy-on-input and copy-on-output model.  Thus,
if the same input binding semantic is used for two different
variables, those variables are initialized with the same value,
but the variables are not aliased thereafter.  Output aliasing is
illegal, but implementations are not required to detect it.  If the
compiler does not issue an error on a program that aliases output
binding semantics, the results are undefined.

</A></A></H2>
<P>
Cg profiles may optionally allow the user to avoid the requirement
that a binding semantic be specified for every non-uniform input (or
output) variable to a top-level program.  To avoid this requirement,
all the non-uniform variables should be included within a single
<CODE>struct</CODE>.  The compiler automatically allocates the elements of this
structure to hardware resources in a manner that allows any program
that returns this <CODE>struct</CODE> to interoperate with any program that uses
this <CODE>struct</CODE> as an input.


</P>
<P>
It is not <I>required</I> that all non-uniform inputs be included
within a single struct in order to omit binding semantics.  Binding
semantics may be omitted from any input or output, and the compiler
 performs automatic allocation of that input or output to a
hardware resource.  However, to guarantee interoperability of one
program's output with another program's input when automatic binding
is performed, it is necessary to put all of the variables in a single
<CODE>struct</CODE>.


</P>
<P>
It is permissible to explicitly specify a binding semantic for some
elements of the <CODE>struct</CODE>, but not others.  The compiler's automatic
allocation must honor these explicit bindings.  The allowed set of
explicitly specified binding semantics is defined by the
allocation-rule identifier.  The most common use of this capability is
to bind variables to hardware registers that write to, or read from,
non-programmable parts of the hardware.  For example, in a typical
vertex-program profile, the output <CODE>struct</CODE> would contain an element
with an explicitly specified POSITION semantic.  This element is used
to control the hardware rasterizer.

ambiguity in the use of the decimal point character. For example,
to create a three-vector from a scalar, use one of the following:
<CODE>(1).xxx</CODE> or <CODE>1..xxx</CODE> or <CODE>1.0.xxx</CODE> or <CODE>1.0f.xxx</CODE>


</P>
<DT><STRONG>-

</STRONG></DT>
<DD>

<P>
The size of the returned vector is determined by the number of
swizzle characters.  Therefore, the size of the result may be larger
or smaller than the size of the original vector.
For example,
<CODE>float2(0,1).xxyy</CODE> and <CODE>float4(0,0,1,1)</CODE> yields the same result.

Matrix swizzle operator:


</P>
<P>
For any matrix type of the form '<type><rows>x<columns>', the
notation: '<matrixObject>._m<row><col>[_m<row><col>][...]' can be
used to access individual matrix elements (in the case of only one
<row>,<col> pair) or to construct vectors from elements of a
matrix (in the case of more than one <row>,<col> pair).
The row and column numbers are zero-based.


</P>
<P>
For example:


</P>
<PRE>        float4x4 myMatrix;
        float    myFloatScalar;
        float4   myFloatVec4;

        // Set myFloatScalar to myMatrix[3][2]
        myFloatScalar = myMatrix._m32;

        // Assign the main diagonal of myMatrix to myFloatVec4
        myFloatVec4 = myMatrix._m00_m11_m22_m33;
</PRE><P>
For compatibility with the D3DMatrix data type, Cg also allows
one-based swizzles, using a form with the <CODE>m</CODE> omitted after the <CODE>_</CODE>:
'<matrixObject>._<row><col>[_<row><col>][...]'  In this
form, the indexes for <row> and <col> are one-based, rather than the
C standard zero-based. So, the two forms are functionally
equivalent:


</P>
<PRE>        float4x4 myMatrix;
        float4   myVec;

        // These two statements are functionally equivalent:
        myVec = myMatrix._m00_m23_m11_m31;
        myVec = myMatrix._11_34_22_42;
</PRE><P>
Because of the confusion that can be caused by the one-based indexing, its
use is strongly discouraged.  Also one-based indexing and zero-based
indexing cannot be mixed in a single swizzle


</P>
<P>
The matrix swizzles may only be applied to matrices.  When multiple
components are extracted from a matrix using a swizzle, the result
is an appropriately sized vector. When a swizzle is used to extract
a single component from a matrix, the result is a scalar.

</LI>
<P>
The write-mask operator: (<CODE>.</CODE>)
It can only be applied to an lvalue that is a vector or matrix.
It allows assignment to particular elements of a vector or matrix,
leaving other elements unchanged.  It looks exactly like a swizzle,
with the additional restriction that a component cannot be repeated.

In many graphics APIs, the user can choose between two different

use a built-in configurable "fixed-function" pipeline or

If the user wishes to mix these two approaches, it is sometimes
desirable to guarantee that the position computed by the first
approach is bit-identical to the position computed by the second
approach.  This "position invariance" is particularly important for
multipass rendering.

</A></A></H2>
<P>
As shown in Table 11, there are three output binding semantics for fragment program profiles:


</P>
<PRE> Table 11  Fragment Output Binding Semantics
 Name    Meaning               Type    Default Value
 ----    -------               ------  -------------
 COLOR   RGBA output color     float4  Undefined
 COLOR0  Same as COLOR
 DEPTH   Fragment depth value  float   Interpolated depth from rasterizer
         (in range [0,1])              (in range [0,1])
</PRE><P>
Profiles may define additional output binding semantics with specific
behaviors, and these definitions are expected to be
consistent across commonly used profiles.


</P>
<P>
If a program desires an output color alpha of 1.0, it should
explicitly write a value of 1.0 to the <CODE>W</CODE> component of the <CODE>COLOR</CODE>
output.  The language does *not* define a default value for this
output.


</P>
<P>
Note: If the target hardware uses a default
value for this output, the compiler may choose to optimize away an
explicit write specified by the user if it matches the default
hardware value.  Such defaults are not exposed in the language.)


</P>
<P>
In contrast, the language does define a default value for the <CODE>DEPTH</CODE>
output.  This default value is the interpolated depth obtained from
the rasterizer.  Semantically, this default value is copied to the
output at the beginning of the execution of the fragment program.


</P>
<P>
As discussed earlier, when a binding semantic is applied to an output,
the type of the output variable is not required to match the type of
the binding semantic.  For example, the following is legal, although
not recommended:


</P>
<PRE>        struct myfragoutput {
            float2 mycolor : COLOR;
        }
</PRE><P>
In such cases, the variable is implicitly copied (with a typecast) to
the semantic upon program completion.  If the variable's vector size
is shorter than the semantic's vector size, the
larger-numbered components of the semantic receive their default
values if applicable, and otherwise are undefined.  In
the case above, the <CODE>R</CODE> and <CODE>G</CODE> components of the output color are
obtained from <CODE>mycolor</CODE>, while the <CODE>B</CODE> and <CODE>A</CODE> components of the color
are undefined.
