   The Mesa distribution consists of several components. Different
   copyrights and licenses apply to different components. For
   example, GLUT is copyrighted by Mark Kilgard, some demo programs
   are copyrighted by SGI, some of the Mesa device drivers are
   copyrighted by their authors. See below for a list of Mesa's
   components and the copyright/license for each.

   The core Mesa library is licensed according to the terms of the
   XFree86 copyright (an MIT-style license). This allows integration
   with the XFree86/DRI project. Unless otherwise stated, the Mesa
   source code and documentation is licensed as follows:

                        Attention, Contributors

   When contributing to the Mesa project you must agree to relinquish
   your work to the holder of the copyright for the particular
   component you're contributing to. That is, you can't put your own
   copyright on the code, unless it's a modular piece that can be
   omitted from Mesa (like a new device driver). If for example, you
   contribute a bug fix to Mesa's texture mapping code, your code
   will become a part of the body of work which is copyrighted by
   Brian Paul and licensed by the above terms.
