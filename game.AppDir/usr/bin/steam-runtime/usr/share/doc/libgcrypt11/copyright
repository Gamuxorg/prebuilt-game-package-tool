Excerpt from upstream's README:

    The library is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License (LGPL); see the file COPYING.LIB for the
    actual terms.  The helper programs (gcryptrnd and getrandom) as
    well as the documentation are distributed under the terms of the
    GNU General Public License (GPL); see the file COPYING for teh
    actual terms.

    This library used to be available under the GPL - this was changed
    with version 1.1.7 with the rationale that there are now many free
    crypto libraries available and many of them come with capabilities
    similar to Libcrypt.  We decided that to foster the use of
    cryptography in Free Software an LGPLed library would make more
    sense because it avoids problems due to license incompatibilities
    between some Free Software licenses and the GPL.

    Please note that in many cases it is better for a library to be
    licensed under the GPL, so that it provides an advantage for free
    software projects.  The Lesser GPL is so named because it does
    less to protect the freedom of the users of the code that it
    covers.  See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html for
    more explanation.
