OSS <--> ALSA PCM plugin
========================

This plugin converts the ALSA API over OSS API.  With this plugin,
ALSA native apps can run on OSS drivers.

This plugin provides the PCM type "oss".  The typical configuration
looks like below:

	pcm.oss {
		type oss
		device /dev/dsp
	}

Put the above to ~/.asoundrc (or /etc/asound.conf), and use "oss" PCM
with your ALSA apps.  For example,

	% aplay -Doss foo.wav

For playing arbitrary formats, you should use "plug" layer together,

	% aplay -Dplug:oss foo.wav

The oss plugin can have an option: device.  This specifies the device
file path of OSS to open.  If not given, /dev/dsp is used.

The function supported by this plugin is limited.  For example, you
cannot use dmix together with this plugin.  Don't expect too much :)

The plugin is installed in /usr/lib/alsa-lib directory as default,
which is the default search path of additional plugins for alsa-lib.
On a 64bit system like x86-64, the proper prefix option (typically,
--prefix=/usr/lib64) must be given to configure script.
