Arcam AV Amplifier ALSA Control plugin
======================================

This plugin exposes the controls for an Arcam AV amplifier
(see: http://www.arcam.co.uk/) as an ALSA mixer device.

To use this plugin you will need to connect the amplifier
to the PC using an RS-232 null-modem cable and use the
following ALSA configuration:

	ctl.arcam_av {
		type arcam_av
		port /dev/ttyS0
	}

The "port" parameter is required and indicates the serial
port to be used to communicate with the amplifier. There is
an optional "zone" parameter, which accepts a value of
either "1" (default) or "2", that indicates which of the
amplifiers zones should be controlled.

NB: You must ensure that any user accounts that are to use
this plugin have both read and write access rights for the
configured serial port.

This plugin was developed and tested using an Arcam AVR 300
amplifier. I believe most Arcam amplifiers use a sufficiently
similar control system to be compatible with this plugin but
your mileage may vary.
