Rate Converter Plugin Using Speex Resampler
===========================================

The plugin in rate subdirectory is an external rate converter using
the Speex resampler (aka Public Parrot Hack) by Jean-Marc Valin.  You can 
use this rate converter plugin by defining a rate PCM with "converter" 
parameter, such as:

	pcm.my_rate {
		type rate
		slave.pcm "hw"
		converter "speexrate"
	}

The plug plugin has also a similar field, "rate_converter".

Or, more easily, define a global variable "defaults.pcm.rate_converter",
which is used as the default converter type by plug and rate plugins:

	defaults.pcm.rate_converter "speexrate"

Write the above in your ~/.asoundrc or /etc/asound.conf.

The following converter types are available:

  - speexrate_best	Use quality 10 (equivalent to SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY)
  - speexrate_medium	Use quality 5 (equivalent to SRC_SINC_MEDIUM_QUALITY)
  - speexrate		Use quality 3 (equivalent to SRC_SINC_FASTEST)
