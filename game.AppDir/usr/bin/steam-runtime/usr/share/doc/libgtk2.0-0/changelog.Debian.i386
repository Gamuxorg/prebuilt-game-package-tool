  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Switch udeb from DirectFB to Xlib to prepare the move to an X11-based
    graphical installer. Closes: #573872.
     - Replace libgtk-directfb-2.0-0-udeb with libgtk-x11-udeb in control
       file.
     - Update description accordingly.
     - Update .install.in accordingly, using the “shared_udeb” flavour,
       based on the “shared” one, but with a few X11 extensions disabled.
     - Update package name and file paths accordingly in rules file.
  * Version/Bump some B-D to make sure the udeb gets proper dependencies
    on the recently reworked/added udebs:
     - libx11-dev
     - libxcursor-dev
     - libxext-dev
     - libxi-dev
     - libxinerama-dev
     - libxrender-dev
  * Add one patch to make it possible to disable X11 extensions, and
    refresh the other one accordingly:
     - 005_support_disabling_x11_extensions.patch
     - 070_mandatory-relibtoolize.patch
  * Ship a minimal MIME database in the udeb, since the loaders mechanism
    isn’t sufficient to get proper PNG support:
     - Add shared-mime-info to Build-Depends to ensure that the
       update-mime-database tool is available at build-time, as well as
       the source freedesktop.org.xml file.
     - Add debian/keep-png-only.xsl to only keep the mime-type matching
       type="image/png". Matching with namespaces is tricky, see the
       comments in the XSL file for the details.
     - Build a MIME cache, and only ship the resulting mime.cache file
       under /usr/share/mime in the udeb.
     - While this is dirty, that should do the trick until it is needed
       for shared-mime-info to ship its own udeb.

  [ Emilio Pozuelo Monfort ]
  * Rename the udeb to libgtk2.0-0-udeb.

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Flip back gdkpixbuf_module_files_d_str after gdkpixbuf_module_file_str in
    patch 021_loader-files-d; this fixes config of gdk loaders and hence the
    current ia32-libs implementation; the change in 2.12.0-3 was incorrect in
    that it flipped the order for im modules and pixbuf loaders, but only im
    modules had to be flipped; the reason im modules had to be flipped is that
    the first list of modules wins for im modules as there is some duplicate
    checking, while in the case of gdk pixbufs, the last file wins.  What
    remains to be done here is:
    - biarch support, similar to pango, by loading /usr/lib32 and /usr/lib64
      stuff before /usr/lib; allows dropping the config file hack in
      ia32-libs.
    - loading of modules from multiarch locations (not multiarch); allows
      dropping the config file hack in ia32-libs.

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Fix broken second dh_strip invocation which was not only acting on the

  * Update patch 021_loader-files-d to use PIXBUF_FILES_LIBDIR which is
    defined in gdk-pixbuf/Makefile.am, similarly to PIXBUF_LIBDIR, and based
    on the newly defined loaderfilesdir, similar to loaderdir; update
    070_mandatory-relibtoolize.
  * New patch, 022_module-files-append-compat-module-files-d, prefer
    /usr/lib32/gtk-2.0/<gtk-binary-version>/loader-files.d and
    /immodule-files.d over the /usr/lib/.../*.d pathnames added in
    020_immodules-files-d and 021_loader-files-d when available; this is
    useful for ia32-libs support; other modules might need additional support
    depending on how they are loaded, for example GTK_MODULES will probably
    still be looked up below libdir, as well as engines, printbackends,
    filesystems, and generic modules.  See also Ubuntu #205223 and #190227 for

  * Stop suggesting gtk-engines-pixmap.
  * Remove the --enable-explicit-deps flag. Closes: #343711, thanks Tom

  * Fix bashishms in debian/rules. (Closes: #385473)
  * Generate a Provides: gtk2.0-binver-@BINVER@ in libgtk2.0-@SONAME@ to track
    the binary version of Gtk and to permit Gtk modules to depend on it.
  * Define the flags for each flavor (shared, static, and udeb) in Makefile
    vars and share the common flags.
  * Only pass --host to configure if DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE and DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE
    differ.
  * Stop shipping *.la and *.a files of modules (all module types).
  * Move GTK_BINARY_VERSION back to rules.
  * Use GTK_BINVER_DEP instead of BINVER.
  * Build flavors out-of-tree; saves 25% of required build space (315 MB) and
    some build time / IO load; this clutters the headers a little (full build
    path is mentionned instead of ".") though.
  * Rewrite and cleanup the build process completely.
  * Install the full set of pkg-config files from the dfb flavor in
    /usr/lib/pkgconfig/libgtk-directfb-2.0; to use this feature, set
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH while invoking pkg-config (or configure); the
    /usr/lib/pkgconfig/*directfb*.pc files will be removed when Debian sources
    have been converted.
  * In the same spirit, gdkconfig.h is in /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/include/directfb;
    to use it, prepend -I/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/include/directfb to CFLAGS.
  * Fix generation of /etc/gtk-2.0/gdk-pixbuf.loaders for the udeb.
    (Closes: #382435)
  * Build-depend on libcairo-directfb2-dev >= 1.2.4-2 to get PDF/PS support in
    the directfb flavor of libcairo.
  * Recommend the linked source packages in libgtk2.0-doc instead of simply
    suggesting them.
  * Rewrite update-gdkpixbuf-loaders and update-gtk-immodules.
  * Drop double libatk1.0-dev build-dep.
  * Empty the dependency_libs in the *.la files of libgtk2.0-dev.
  * New immodule files handling with *.immodules files below
    /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<BINARY_VERSION>/immodule-files.d.
    - New patch, 020_immodules-files-d, to split the module search path on
      ":", as is done in Pango, prepend
      /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<BINARY_VERSION>/immodule-files.d to the search path,
      and to read all *.immodules files when a directory is encountered in the
      search path.
    - Pre-generate
      /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<BINARY_VERSION>/immodule-files.d/libgtk2.0-0.immodules
      for the shared library.
    - Continue generating /etc/gtk-2.0/gtk.immodules until packages are
      updated.
  * Add the libpixmap engine to the udeb for the new Bladr GTK theme for g-i.
  * New loader files handling with *.loaders files below
    /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<BINARY_VERSION>/loaders-files.d.
    - New patch, 021_loader-files-d, to split the module search path on
      ":", as is done in Pango, prepend
      /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<BINARY_VERSION>/loader-files.d to the search path,
      and to read all *.loaders files when a directory is encountered in the
      search path.
    - Pre-generate
      /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<BINARY_VERSION>/loader-files.d/libgtk2.0-0.loaders
      for the shared library and libgtk-directfb-2.0-0-udeb.loaders for the
      udeb.
    - Continue generating /etc/gtk-2.0/gdk-pixbuf.loaders until packages are
      updated.
    - This particular patch uses two ugly workarounds and needs work before
      being sent upstream.
  * New Debhelper-based command, dh_gtkmodules, to create module files for IM
    modules and GdkPixbuf loaders; it will still add a dependency on the
    binary version of Gtk for other modules.
  * Make use of the new dh_gtkmodules during the build (override the path to
    gtk-query-immodules-2.0 and gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to gtk2-engines-pixbuf.

gtk+2.0 (2.8.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    - gtk-update-icon-cache no longer stores copies of symlinked icons,
      and it has a --index-only option to omit image data from the cache.
    - Make large GtkSizeGroups more efficient.
    - Improve positioning of menus in GtkToolbar.
    - Make scrolling work on unrealized icon views.
    - Avoid unnecessary redraws on range widgets.
    - Make sure that all GTK+ applications reload icon themes promptly.
    - Ensure that gdk_pango_get_context() and gtk_widget_get_pango_context()
      use the same font options and dpi value.
    - Multiple memory leak fixes.
  * debian/control.in:
    - updated the libgtk2.0-dev Depends according to the changes.
  * debian/rules:
    Add --enable-explicit-deps=yes to make sure stuff like x11 gets listed as a
    Requires: in gdk(-x11)-2.0.pc, because otherwise linkage against -lX11 and
    friends doesn't get carried through.  Whether or not this is correct is
    arguable, since libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0* ends up linked against it anyway, but
    stuff like gnome-panel seems to be relying on this transience.
